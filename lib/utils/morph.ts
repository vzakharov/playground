/**
 * Morphs an object to a new object, assigning identically named properties from the source object to the target object and deleting properties from the target object that are not present in the source object.
 * 
 * After morphing, the target object will be type narrowed to `never` so that it cannot be accidentally used. If you do need to use it according to the new type, you'll need to typecast it manually using `as`.
 * 
 * This is due to a limitation of TypeScript that doesnâ€™t allow us to assert the target is of the same type as the morphed (i.e. source) object without the latter extending the former.
